2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your domain
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- Vercel is FREE for personal projects
- Your website will be publicly accessible via the URL
- Updates are instant after deployment
- You can preview changes before making them live
- All your files stay on your computer - Vercel just hosts them

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If images don't load:
- Make sure image paths are correct (relative paths like "assets/images/logo.png")
- Check that all images are in the assets/images folder

If language toggle doesn't work:
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled in browser
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

If styles look wrong:
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check that css/styles.css path is correct

QUICK START (FASTEST METHOD):

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
